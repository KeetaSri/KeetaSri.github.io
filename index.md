## Who is Keetawat

Just an ordinary person with high hope and high expectations, with a lot of passion on become one as a game developer.

Though I still lack of knowledge to create a masterpiece of my own video game.

### My Education

I'm an Software and Knowledge and currently studying at Kasetsart University.

Love all the subject that fuel my need for gaming material.

But the backlash hit me by sending all my worse subject to F grade, cause I don't care that much.
